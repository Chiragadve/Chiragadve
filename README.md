Hi 👋 My name is Chirag Adve
==========================

Full Stack Developer
-------------------

Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile. I am **Chirag Adve**, a Computer Engineering undergraduate with a strong interest in backend systems, APIs, and problem solving.

I enjoy building software that is practical, scalable, and thoughtfully designed. Most of my work focuses on RESTful APIs, authentication systems, caching strategies, and data driven applications. I place strong emphasis on clean logic, understanding architectural tradeoffs, and building solutions that address real problems rather than superficial features.

Alongside development, I actively practice Data Structures and Algorithms to strengthen my problem solving skills and deepen my understanding of system fundamentals.

### Currently exploring

- Backend architecture and API design  
- Authentication, authorization, and system security  
- Scalable application patterns  
- Performance optimization and caching  
- Problem solving through DSA  

If something here sparks your interest, feel free to explore the repositories or reach out.
